# haskell-scheme

This is a basic interpreter for the Scheme programming language, a work in progress. More information regarding the state of this project, 
and documentation on how to use it will be added later.

## Build documentation
- Run `./clean` to remove any and all files except for Haskell source `.hs`
- Run `./build` to build the main interpreter
- Run `./eval` to start the interpreter
